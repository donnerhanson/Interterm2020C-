Assignment:
Problem 3 (employeepay):
An employee is paid at a rate of $16.00 per hour for regular hours worked in a week. Any hours over that
are paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half times that. From the worker’s gross pay, 6% is withheld
for Social Security tax, 14% is withheld for federal income tax, 5% is withheld for state income tax, and
$10 per week is withheld for medical insurance.

Write a program that will read in the number of hours worked in a week as input and that will then output the worker’s gross pay, each withholding amount, and the net take-home pay for the week.

Perform all functionality within the main function and include a README and MakeFile.

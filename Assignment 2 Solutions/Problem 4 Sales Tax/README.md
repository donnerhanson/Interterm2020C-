Assignment:
Problem 4 (salestax.cpp): Implement a function called addTax. The function addTax has two formal parameters: taxRate, which is the amount of sales tax expressed as a percent; and cost, which is the cost of an item before tax. The function returns the value (float) of cost so that it includes sales tax.

Assignment:
Create a class called Pet with all the necessary files
(.h , .cpp, etc.) This class should have member
variables name (string), age (int), type ([‘dog’, ‘cat’]) (string)
and weight (double).
Make sure to include the appropriate accessor (getters), mutator
(setters).
Once the Pet class has been implemented, create two instances of
Pet and print their details to console output.
